  #Part 1- My flag
  My flag is the US flag.The colors on the flag mean different things for example red symbolizes hardiness and valor, white symbolizes purity and innocence, and blue represents vigilance, perseverance and justice.The flag also has 50 stars on the top left corner to reprsent the 50 states while the flag has 13 stripes repsentes the 13 colonies that fought againest the Britsh for independence.
  The simple shapes made to use this flag are retangle and stars.
 
 #Part 2 - Questions and challenges
 Some challenges I faced was not having the right color, it was very hard to make it using colors like pink and a very light sky blue or something like that.Another one was since my flag wasn't as small like other peoples cuting out bigger shapes while making it stright was really hard and looked a bit weird.
